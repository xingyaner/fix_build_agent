# Default build script for ttf-parser
# This script might need adjustments based on the project's specific build system.

# Example build command (adjust as needed):
# Assume the project uses CMake or a similar build system.
# mkdir -p build && cd build
# cmake ..
# make -j$(nproc)

# If it uses a Python setup.py:
# python setup.py build

# For OSS-Fuzz, a typical build might involve compiling C/C++ code
# or setting up a Python environment.

# Placeholder for build command. Replace with actual build steps.
# For now, we'll just ensure the directory exists and exit successfully.

# project.py for ttf-parser

# This file is typically used by OSS-Fuzz to define project-specific settings.
# For a Python project, it might define the main fuzzer entry point.

# Example:
# import sys
# 
# def fuzz(data):
#     # Your fuzzing logic here
#     # Parse the input data using the ttf-parser library
#     try:
#         # Replace with actual parsing logic
#         print(f"Received data of length: {len(data)}")
#         # Example: ttf_parser.parse(data)
#     except Exception as e:
#         print(f"Error during fuzzing: {e}")

# if __name__ == "__main__":
#     # Example of how to run the fuzzer standalone (for testing)
#     test_data = b"SOME_TEST_DATA"
#     fuzz(test_data)
