  - STATE_UPDATE: {'fuzz_build_log': "Based on my investigation, here's what I've found:\n\n## Summary of Failure Investigation\n\n**Build Status**: The fuzzing build for the mosquitto project failed.\n\n**Error Details**: \n- The main mosquitto project compilation succeeded (libraries, applications, plugins, etc.)\n- The failure occurred during the fuzzing target compilation phase\n- Specific error: `make[2]: /src/libprotobuf-mutator/external.protobuf/bin/protoc: Command not found`\n\n**Root Cause Analysis**:\n1. The build is trying to compile fuzzing targets that use Protocol Buffers\n2. The `protoc` compiler (Protocol Buffers compiler) is not available in the build environment\n3. The path `/src/libprotobuf-mutator/external.protobuf/bin/protoc` suggests that protobuf-mutator should be installed but it's not found\n\n**Configuration Files Examined**:\n1. `build.sh` - Simple script that calls `./fuzzing/scripts/oss-fuzz-build.sh`\n2. `Dockerfile` - Uses base-builder image and runs `oss-fuzz-dependencies.sh`\n3. `project.yaml` - Basic project configuration showing C language with various sanitizers and fuzzing engines\n\n**Key Findings**:\n- The mosquitto source directory doesn't have a `fuzzing` directory in the downloaded source\n- The build log shows the fuzzing build is happening inside the Docker container at `/src/mosquitto/fuzzing/`\n- The error occurs when trying to generate Protocol Buffers code for fuzzing targets\n\n**Potential Issues**:\n1. Missing dependency: protobuf-mutator or protobuf compiler not installed in the Docker image\n2. The `oss-fuzz-dependencies.sh` script might not be installing all required dependencies\n3. The fuzzing build might require additional setup that's not properly configured\n\nThe build failure is specifically related to the fuzzing target compilation, not the main mosquitto project build. The main project compiled successfully, but the fuzzing targets require additional dependencies (protobuf compiler) that are not available in the build environment."}
