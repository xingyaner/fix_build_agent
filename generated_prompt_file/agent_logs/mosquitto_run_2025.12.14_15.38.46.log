The issue is that the Docker build is using cached layers, so it's not actually running the dependency installation.\n\nBased on my investigation, here's my analysis:\n\n## Fuzzing Build Failure Investigation Report\n\n### Summary\nThe fuzzing build for the mosquitto project failed due to a missing dependency: the Protocol Buffers compiler (`protoc`) from libprotobuf-mutator.\n\n### Error Details\n**Primary Error**: \n```\n/src/libprotobuf-mutator/external.protobuf/bin/protoc: Command not found\nmake[2]: *** [Makefile:28: libcommon_fuzz_property.pb.cc] Error 127\n```\n\n**Location**: The error occurs in `/src/mosquitto/fuzzing/libcommon/Makefile` at line 28, where it tries to compile a Protocol Buffers `.proto` file.\n\n### Root Cause Analysis\n1. **Missing Dependency**: The build requires `libprotobuf-mutator` which provides the `protoc` compiler for Protocol Buffers.\n\n2. **Docker Cache Issue**: The Docker build is using cached layers, as shown by the `CACHED` lines in the build log:\n   - `#6 [2/5] RUN git clone --depth 1 -b develop https://github.com/eclipse/mosquitto /src/mosquitto` - CACHED\n   - `#7 [3/5] RUN /src/mosquitto/fuzzing/scripts/oss-fuzz-dependencies.sh` - CACHED\n\n3. **Dependency Script**: The `oss-fuzz-dependencies.sh` script (which should install libprotobuf-mutator and other dependencies) is not being executed due to Docker layer caching.\n\n### Build Configuration Files\n1. **Dockerfile**: Shows the build process clones mosquitto from the `develop` branch and runs `oss-fuzz-dependencies.sh`\n2. **build.sh**: Simply calls `./fuzzing/scripts/oss-fuzz-build.sh` (which wasn't found in the downloaded repository)\n\n### Recommendations for Fix\n1. **Clear Docker Cache**: The Docker build cache needs to be cleared to force re-execution of the dependency installation step.\n2. **Ensure libprotobuf-mutator Installation**: Verify that `oss-fuzz-dependencies.sh` properly installs libprotobuf-mutator.\n3. **Check Protocol Buffers Dependency**: Ensure the Protocol Buffers compiler is available in the build environment.\n\nThe build was proceeding successfully through most of the compilation steps (broker fuzzers, apps fuzzers) but failed at the libcommon fuzzer compilation stage due to the missing protoc dependency."}
