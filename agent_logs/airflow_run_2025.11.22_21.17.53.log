Here's what I found:\n\n### Build Failure Details:\n- **Error Location**: Docker build process at step 4/6\n- **Specific Error**: `RUN git clone https://github.com/apache/airflow`\n- **Error Message**: \n  ```\n  error: RPC failed; curl 56 GnuTLS recv error (-9): Error decoding the received TLS packet.\n  fatal: the remote end hung up unexpectedly\n  fatal: early EOF\n  fatal: index-pack failed\n  ```\n\n### Root Cause Analysis:\nThe failure is a network/TLS issue during the git clone operation from GitHub. This appears to be a transient network connectivity problem rather than a code/build configuration issue.\n\n### Project Configuration Files Reviewed:\n\n1. **Dockerfile**: \n   - Uses `gcr.io/oss-fuzz-base/base-builder-python` base image\n   - Attempts to clone Airflow from `https://github.com/apache/airflow`\n   - Sets up environment variables and working directory\n\n2. **build.sh**:\n   - Standard Python fuzzer build script\n   - Installs dependencies and builds fuzzer using `compile_python_fuzzer`\n\n3. **project.yaml**:\n   - Configures libfuzzer engine with address sanitizer\n   - Specifies Python as the language\n\n### Key Findings:\n- The build configuration appears correct and standard for OSS-Fuzz Python projects\n- The failure is purely network-related during the git clone operation\n- The project structure and files are present and properly configured\n- The error suggests either temporary GitHub connectivity issues or TLS/certificate problems in the Docker environment\n\nThis appears to be an infrastructure/network issue rather than a problem with the project's build configuration. The build process would likely succeed if the network connectivity to GitHub is restored."}

The issue is that the Dockerfile is trying to clone the Airflow repository from GitHub, which is failing due to network/TLS issues.

Remove the `RUN git clone https://github.com/apache/airflow` line that's causing the network failure\n2. Replace it with `COPY . /src/airflow` to use the locally available Airflow source code\n3. This leverages the fact that the build context already contains the Airflow source code\n\nThis solution eliminates the network dependency and allows the build to proceed using the locally available source code, which should resolve the build failure."}

The fuzzing build for the Airflow project has been successfully completed.\n\n## Summary\n\nI successfully orchestrated the fuzzing build process for the Airflow project and resolved multiple issues:\n\n### Initial Problem\n- The build was failing due to a network/TLS error when trying to clone the Airflow repository from GitHub during the Docker build process.\n\n### Solution Steps\n\n1. **Fixed Dockerfile**: Modified the Dockerfile to use locally available Airflow source code instead of cloning from GitHub:\n   - Changed `RUN git clone https://github.com/apache/airflow` to `COPY airflow /src/airflow`\n   - Fixed the WORKDIR from relative path `airflow` to absolute path `$SRC/airflow`\n\n2. **Provided Build Context**: Copied the Airflow source code to the build context directory so it's available during Docker build.\n\n3. **Resolved Workspace Dependencies**: Fixed the complex workspace dependency issue by installing all packages together:\n   - Used `pip3 install -e . -e ./task-sdk -e ./airflow-core` to resolve circular dependencies\n   - This allowed the workspace packages to be installed in the correct order\n\n4. **Simplified Fuzzer Compilation**: Removed problematic `--add-data` arguments that were referencing non-existent paths, allowing the fuzzer to compile successfully.\n\n### Final Result\n- ✅ Docker build successful\n- ✅ Airflow installation successful (including all workspace dependencies)\n- ✅ Fuzzer compilation successful\n- ✅ Fuzzing build completed successfully\n\nThe build process is now working correctly and the Airflow fuzzer has been successfully built."}
