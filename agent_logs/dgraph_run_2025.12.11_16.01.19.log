  - STATE_UPDATE: {'fuzz_build_log': "Now I have a clear understanding of the issue. Let me summarize my investigation:\n\n## Preliminary Investigation Results\n\n**Build Failure Analysis:**\n\nThe fuzzing build for the `dgraph` project failed with the following error:\n```\nno required module provides package github.com/hypermodeinc/dgraph/v25/dql; to add it:\n    go get github.com/hypermodeinc/dgraph/v25/dql\n```\n\n**Root Cause:**\n\n1. **Module Path Mismatch**: The `build.sh` script attempts to compile a fuzzer using the module path `github.com/hypermodeinc/dgraph/v25/dql`, but the Dockerfile clones the repository from `https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph`.\n\n2. **Configuration Files**:\n   - `Dockerfile`: Clones `https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph`\n   - `build.sh`: Uses `compile_native_go_fuzzer github.com/hypermodeinc/dgraph/v25/dql FuzzParserTest parser_fuzzer`\n   - `project.yaml`: Lists main repo as `https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph` and primary contact as `security@hypermode.com`\n\n3. **The Issue**: There's an inconsistency between the repository source (`dgraph-io/dgraph`) and the expected Go module path (`hypermodeinc/dgraph/v25`). This suggests either:\n   - The repository was moved/renamed from `dgraph-io/dgraph` to `hypermodeinc/dgraph`\n   - The module path in the repository's `go.mod` file is `github.com/hypermodeinc/dgraph/v25`\n   - The build configuration needs to be updated to match the actual repository structure\n\n**Files Examined:**\n1. `fuzz_build_log_file/fuzz_build_log.txt` - Full build log showing the error\n2. `/root/fix_build_agent/oss-fuzz/projects/dgraph/build.sh` - Build script with incorrect module path\n3. `/root/fix_build_agent/oss-fuzz/projects/dgraph/fuzz_parser_test.go` - Fuzzer test file\n4. `/root/fix_build_agent/oss-fuzz/projects/dgraph/Dockerfile` - Docker configuration\n5. `/root/fix_build_agent/oss-fuzz/projects/dgraph/project.yaml` - Project metadata\n\n**Next Steps Needed:**\nThe build configuration needs to be corrected to use the proper module path. Either:\n1. Update `build.sh` to use `github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/dql` instead of `github.com/hypermodeinc/dgraph/v25/dql`\n2. Or verify if the repository structure has changed and update all configuration files accordingly\n\nThe issue appears to be a configuration mismatch where the build expects one module path but the actual repository provides another."}

  - STATE_UPDATE: {'fuzz_build_log': 'Perfect! The build log now contains just the word "success", which confirms that the fuzzing build completed successfully after applying the fix.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe fuzzing build for the dgraph project has been successfully completed. Here\'s what happened:\n\n1. **Initial Build Failure**: The first build failed with a module path mismatch error. The build script was trying to compile using `github.com/hypermodeinc/dgraph/v25/dql` but the Dockerfile was cloning from `https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph`.\n\n2. **Investigation**: I examined the configuration files and identified the root cause:\n   - `Dockerfile`: Clones `https://github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph`\n   - `build.sh`: Used `compile_native_go_fuzzer github.com/hypermodeinc/dgraph/v25/dql FuzzParserTest parser_fuzzer`\n   - The mismatch was between `hypermodeinc` (organization in build.sh) and `dgraph-io` (actual repository organization)\n\n3. **Fix Applied**: The solution was to change the module path in `build.sh` from `github.com/hypermodeinc/dgraph/v25/dql` to `github.com/dgraph-io/dgraph/v25/dql`.\n\n4. **Successful Build**: After applying the fix, the fuzzing build completed successfully, and the build log now contains just the word "success".\n\nThe fix resolved the module path mismatch issue, allowing the Go module system to correctly locate and compile the fuzzer for the dgraph project.'}
